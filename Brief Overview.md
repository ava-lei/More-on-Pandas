# More-on-Pandas
the code uses the Pandas library along with Matplotlib and time series methods in Python language to solve some interesting dataframe-related problems and contains the following procedures:

perform data analysis using Pandas | read the csv file to a dataframe | reset indexes | create new attributes | sort values by columns | select certain portions of dataframe by conditions | plot scatterplots and line plots using data in dataframe | smooth curves in plots

the piece more specifically focuses on reading and storing a dataframe; resetting the index to an existing column; creating dataframe from existing one's attributes; identifying objects that has certain attributes; adding and deleting columns to a dataframe; creating a copy of dataframe; sorting values of dataframe by an attribute; finding the object with the highest desired attribute value; converting the date column to a timestamp using datetime; ploting plots in subplot positions of a figure; ploting attributes over time; smoothing out curves by rolling method
